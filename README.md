# Convert From DOCX to Anki Deck

1. First you need to create your word document based on a prefix schema question and answer and maybe after the answer you can insert an image

so:

ask (enter)
answer(enter)
{ image (enter) }

that is a card schema

2. Than you need py mammoth library inside your pc and execute 'mammoth input.docx --output-dir=out

3. So out would be the folder where an HTML and some images where stored here you need to save the code that I uploaded in this repo

4. Execute the file and an output anki deck is made

5. Double click on it and all the new deck would be imported into your anki profile
